Overview

Kurogo is available under a liberal open source MIT license. This mean you 
are free to download, install, copy, modify and use the software as you see 
fit.

==========================
Mobile Web REST Additions
==========================

Kurogo iOS apps are intimately tied to a server running Kurogo Mobile Web.
The Mobile Web component includes a REST API required for most modules.
See the Mobile Web documentation for how to customize the output of the
REST API.

=======
Modules
=======

Modules are the core building block of any Kurogo application.  Modules are 
contained pieces of code that (typically) connect to external services and 
process data for display.
